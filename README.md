Description:

This is a fun and simple application that demonstrates the use of "handlebars" and mysql database capabilities. It allows you to view, add, and "devour" any burger that you can think of.

Installation:

You simply need a browser that supports javascript. Visit the deployed heroku link in your browswer. Alternatively you can clone this repository, and run from your local computer. You have to have Node.js installed. Then in the directory of this applications main folder, execute the command "node server.js". From there, go to the localhost:PORT in your browser. This can be done both on or offline as long as you can connect to the sql database.

Usage:

When the user opens the application page, they are presented with a simple user interface. From here they are able to type the name of their digital burger, then add it to a list, and "devour" it. This moves it to a list of "devoured" burgers.
